            Even if you have an indoor cat, it’s best to make sure your feline has a microchip cat ID, since they are very likely to be escape artists. But how can you best track your cat? In the past, simple collar tags with the name and address of the pet owners were attached to the cat. Nowadays, we have various, much more useful tracking and identification options, such as GPS and Bluetooth trackers, microchips, etc. So what to choose for your feline’s safety?

This article explains why it is not possible to keep track of your cat by relying solely on a microchip. It will also clarify the difference between microchips, GPS and Bluetooth trackers, and explains what your cat really needs to be safe.

What are microchips for cats?
A microchip for cats is an identification tool; an electronic chip of the size of a grain of rice, implanted under the skin of your kitty. The unique chip contains an ID number for identifying the owner of the cat, in case your feline friend gets lost. The chip is injected carefully between the shoulder blades of your cat and the painless procedure lasts only a few seconds.

Once the chip is implanted, it works in case your cat goes missing, and is brought to a vet or shelter. There they will be able to scan the microchip to identify, and hopefully, contact you, the owner of the lost cat. Your contact details must be kept up-to-date in the database, otherwise the microchip might be ineffective in reuniting you with your cat.

⚠️ Microchips alone are not useful in the active search for your lost cat, and microchips cannot help you find your cat in real-time. 

With a microchip, you rely on a stranger to find, retrieve and bring your lost cat to a vet or shelter, then contact you. However, in general, microchips for cats are a more reliable form of identification than collar tags, which can fall off or become illegible.

Should you microchip your cat?
It’s good practice to have all of your cats fit with a microchip (for identification purposes) once they are old enough. Since outdoor cats are most at risk of being lost or stolen, microchips are especially important for cats allowed outside. In addition to a microchip cat implant, a GPS tracker for cats is recommended (more on that below).

In many countries, cat microchips are regulated and required by law. Should a non-identifiable feline be found lost on the streets, it could even be euthanized. Hence, microchipping your cat is a basic safety precaution that should be taken by all cat owners.

Are you relocating with your kitty? Remember, a microchip is only useful when you keep the contact information for the ID registration up to date.
